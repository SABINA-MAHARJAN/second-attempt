<p> The personality test helped me know myself more in depth and grow within.

Some of the 'Advocate' traits are resourceful, creative and motivated.
These trait will help myself and my team collaborate seamlessly and achieve our goal to succeed.
This test is just to get an idea of which areas appeal to yourself, capabilities and understanding of why we prefer certain things than others.
So I think, we should not be overwhelmed or carried away with those qualities as we know what we are capable of and be optimistic.

    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>
    Technology plays vital role to humans’ day to day living.
    There is no person in earth that does not use technology.
    One of the major impact of technology is the way we communicate with our friends and family worldwide through electronic means.
     Internet has helped learning more interactive, fun, share new ideas and advance knowledge.
      Technology has improved and destruct human lives. People are so dependent on technology that we have stop using brain. For simple mathematics, we need calculator. People are less interactive face to face and prefer email and chat to share their feelings and emotions.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>We live in digital world and things are getting done in one click of the button online. Due to this, cybercrimes, fraud and scams are increasing rapidly and now many people are very suspicious about using technologies. As I work in banking and financial service, I have experienced lots of customer getting scammed and victim of identity theft. One of the major issues is unauthorized transaction and digital fraud and I always find this very interesting that how criminals are accessing files and manipulating fraud detection system.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The IT project that I would like to work on relates to above mentioned issue. In our day-to-day life, we are extremely dependent on technologies and without this we hardly can sail smoothly. When we purchase items online or in store now, due to advance technologies we do not have to carry card which save us carrying thick wallet with cash and plastic card. However, there is a high risk of data breach and exposure of personal information. This may lead to hacking of bank account, phishing, identification theft and scam which we are arising rapidly. Every transaction in store and online requires bank card, chip or secret pin number. Though chip on card has more security and most of the transaction requires pin and CVV for validation, I believe there is a need of new technologies for secure payment.  It is high time to introduce a unique authentication like every individual’s unique fingerprint for extra security and verification rather than using pin code or password. Now a days, we can find most of the electronic products such as smartphones, laptop, tablets, and computers also has a fingerprint scanner authentication. The magnetic strip found at the back of our ATM plastic card has customer information and it is more vulnerable than chip
  attached to the card. I think getting rid of the magnetic strip on plastic and card number may help resolve
  the matter to some extent and there will no
   financial loss and insecurity.</p>

<h2>Tools and Skills Required </h2>

<p>The tools require for this project is the biometric fingerprint scanning device attached to ATM and EFTPos terminal and software like MorphoManager to analyze and record every individual fingerprint which addresses the inherent factor (those associated with the biological identity of a user). Biometric sensor will be able to capture fingerprint easily and software application will then transfer record to corresponding reader. The portable scanner can be plug into the PC’s USB drive and pair with software for secure method of transaction.</p>

 <h2>Outcome</h2>
 <p>Biometrics provides more security that cannot be
    misplaces and stolen. Because of the pattern of
    ridges are unique to every individual, it gives
     high security, convenience and quick ID setup
     on those devices. Many people struggle with
     memorizing their pin code and password, so it is
     less hassle and avoid signature forgery.
     This innovation will help in minimizing financial
     loss to business and customer insecurity and wary
     to use technologies.</p>
